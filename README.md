## UK keyboard mapping for win8+ on a MacBook Pro 2014

I couldn't find a working keyboard layout for a Windows VM on my UK model 2014 MacBook Pro retina 15".

There is a version at [Nick Bettison's site](http://www.linickx.com/macbook-pro-uk-keyboard-layout). It uses the [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964665.aspx) to do the mappings. However it has no CAPS defined, and mismaps the # key.

So here's my own update to Nick's mappings. 
Simply run the .exe, or you can make changes yourself from the included source fle and regenerate the project.

â‚¬ is on Ctrl-Shift-2, 
pound/hash # is on Ctrl-Shift-3
